# 📊 Machine Learning Algorithms: KNN & K-Means Clustering

This repository demonstrates the implementation of key machine learning algorithms with a focus on **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **K-Means Clustering**.

🔹 **KNN** is implemented **from scratch** using Python and NumPy.  
🔹 **KNN** is implemented using **Scikit-Learn**.  
🔹 **K-Means Clustering** ML algorithms is implemented using **Scikit-Learn**.
