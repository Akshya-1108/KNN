# ðŸ“Š K-Nearest-Network Algorithm from scikit-learn(Python)

This project demonstrates the **K-nearest network** built from `scikit-learn` built in algorithms, with synthetic data generated via `scikit-learn`. It visually represents the implementation of KNN on a synthetic data

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Implements K-nearest-network using `scikit-learn`'s built-in algorithm
- Step-by-step process for:
  - splitting data
  - initializing the model
  - prediction
- Visualizes networks using Matplotlib
- Synthetic dataset generated using `make_blobs`
- Normalization of data for better convergence

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Generate a synthetic dataset with defined centers.
2. Normalize the dataset for balanced clustering.
3. Initialize `knn` using `KNeighborsClassifier`.
4. Testing the accuracy of the model using scikit-learn.
5. Visualize final clusters with colored points and centroid stars.

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Install them using:

````bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn





ðŸ“‚ Usage

Clone the repository or download the Python file.

Run the script:

```bash
python KNNUsingSKlearn.py



ðŸ“ˆ Output

- The script outputs a final meshgrid plot showing:
  - Clustered points in color
  - Centroids marked as black stars
